This project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Siamese Neural Networks on Face Recognition by using different similarity metrics such as Euclidean distance, Cosine Similarity, Mahalanobis distance and Mean Squared Error Distance. The focus is on the task of few-shot learning, where only a few examples of each class are observed before making a prediction on a test instance. Multiple approaches have been employed to compare the accuracy of face recognition.
